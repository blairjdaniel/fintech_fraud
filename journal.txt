A great way to leverage that rich, hourly OHLCV data is to build an end-to-end **Crypto Price Prediction & Insights Platform**. This will hit SQL, EDA, ML modeling, and dashboarding—showcasing the full lifecycle of a data product.

---

## 1. Ingest & Store (SQL)

- **Warehouse:** Stand up a Postgres (or BigQuery) instance.
- **Tables:**  
  - `crypto_prices` (timestamp, symbol, open, high, low, close, volume, …)  
- **ETL:**  
  - Write a Python script that reads your CSVs for BTC, ETH, SOL, etc., and upserts into `crypto_prices`.  
  - Schedule it via Airflow or a cron job so new hourly data lands automatically.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **SQL Queries + Pandas:**  
  - Compute daily/hourly returns, realized volatility, volume spikes:  
    ```sql
    SELECT
      symbol,
      DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day,
      AVG((close - open)/open) AS avg_return,
      STDDEV((close - open)/open) AS volatility
    FROM crypto_prices
    GROUP BY symbol, day;
    ```  
  - In a Jupyter notebook, pull these aggregates and visualize:  
    - Time-series of returns vs. volatility per asset  
    - Correlation heatmaps between assets’ returns  
    - Volume-to-trade ratios over time  

## 3. Feature Engineering & ML Modeling

- **Features:**  
  - Technical indicators (rolling means, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)  
  - Volume-based signals (hour-over-hour volume change, taker buy/sell ratios)  
  - Time features (hour of day, day of week)  
- **Label:**  
  - **Classification:** Next-hour up/down movement (binary).  
  - or **Regression:** Next-hour percent return.
- **Modeling:**  
  - Split by time (train on 2017–2022, test on 2023–today).  
  - Train XGBoost (or a small neural net) via scikit-learn.  
  - Evaluate with accuracy/ROC (for classification) or MAE/R² (for regression).  
  - Serialize your best model with `joblib`.

## 4. Dashboard & Insights (Tableau)

- **Connect Tableau** to your Postgres `crypto_prices` and model output tables (e.g. `predictions`).
- **Dashboard Components:**  
  1. **Live Price Chart** with predicted next-hour direction highlighted.  
  2. **Model Performance Panel:** Confusion matrix or error metrics over rolling windows.  
  3. **Indicator Explorer:** Interactive selectors for symbol and date range showing key indicators vs. actual outcomes.  
  4. **Anomaly Alerts:** Highlight hours where volume or price moved beyond historical thresholds.

### Why This Project?

- **SQL:** Designing tables & writing analytical queries in your warehouse.  
- **EDA:** Combining SQL + pandas to uncover patterns across multiple assets.  
- **ML:** End-to-end feature engineering, modeling, validation, and serialization.  
- **Dashboarding:** Bringing it all together in Tableau for a polished, interactive user experience.  

This pipeline—illustrated with code, notebooks, and a live dashboard—will make a standout GitHub repo and LinkedIn project, demonstrating your ability to build a full-stack data science product on top of blockchain and financial data.

Join the btc table with btc historical, then work on splitting it into the 4 halvings

Here are the dates of Bitcoin’s halving events to date:

First halving: November 28, 2012 
Bitbo Calendar

Second halving: July 9, 2016 
Bitbo Calendar

Third halving: May 11, 2020 
Bitbo Calendar

Fourth halving: April 19, 2024

Normalize each series to daily % change (e.g. (Pₜ/Pₜ₋₁) – 1), then compute rolling correlations or regress your asset’s returns on these benchmarks.

Inflation-adjusted returns: deflate your asset’s nominal returns by daily TIPS breakeven to get real returns.

Multi-factor analysis: build a simple linear model or PCA to see which “barometer” explains most of your asset’s daily variance.
